# Todo-app-with-rest-api
This is a simple android application that works with my custom api (https://github.com/hayato1234/Rest-api-for-android-application).
You need to replace base url in /service/TodoClient
String baseUrl = "your_address"; (replace your_address)

Libraries used are butterknife, retrofit, retrofit-converter, gson. (in Build.gradle)
